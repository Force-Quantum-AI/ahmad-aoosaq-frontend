            question: "How will the AI handle customers who struggle to speak English?",
            answer: "HYLN's AI is multilingual and can detect the caller's language to respond accordingly, or it can gracefully transfer the call to a human staff member if needed.",

        {
            question: "Is patient data secure and compliant with regulations?",
            answer: "Security is our top priority. Our platform is fully HIPAA and PDPL compliant, ensuring all patient data is encrypted and handled according to the highest industry standards.",
        },
        {
            question: "What happens if a patient has an emergency?",
